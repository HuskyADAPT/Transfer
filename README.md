# Group PROJECT 
Transitioning from sitting to standing may be challenging for people with altered leg strength or balance. These individuals need a way to comfortably and safely transition from sit-to-stand-to-sit during their daily life. In Carolee’s case she currently uses her Freedom Chair to lift her into a standing posture; however, when it is time to sit down she “drops” or “falls” into place which can be uncomfortable and dangerous. She also relies on her husband, Tom, to assist with her transfers which can be taxing on his strength and time. Individuals with leg weakness need better tools to support safe transfers that reduce reliance on expensive devices or family support.
